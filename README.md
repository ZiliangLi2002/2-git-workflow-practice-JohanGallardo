#[Article - ChatGPT Isn't Coming for Your Coding Job](https://www.wired.com/story/chatgpt-coding-software-crisis/)

## I chose this article since I remembe the ChatGPT hype from last year. This article talks about the fear in the software engineering community that their career have been added to the list of jobs that ChatGPT will replace. It points out that this fear is nothing new as there have been many times in the past where new technologies threatened to end the role of the software engineer. Many of the technologies are no longer popular and yet the software engineer is still here. In most cases these technologies aid engineers and make them more desirable to hire or they fail without the use of software engineers. Either way the role of software engineer will still be in demand. I think this article is very useful to read especially with the current sentiment about the software engineering job market. Looking at new technologies as helpful tools rather than job destroyers will only benefit the modern software engineer.
